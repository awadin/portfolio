                            solutions for a webâ€‘based enterprise management system used by large international telecommunications companies. My experience within
                            both academic and work environments has honed my abilities to pick up new concepts quickly, enhanced my attention to detail, and elevated
                            my leadership skills.

                            In the slideshow is one example of my recent work. I created a import wizard that guided users through the process of uploading, formatting, and adding contacts to their portal. I was in charge of designing the overall layout and flow, coding the panels - both front end visuals and back end validation. I worked headed a team of about 4 developers to work in coordination to complete the full process using Agile methodologies.
